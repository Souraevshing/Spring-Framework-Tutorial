# Constructor injection in spring

## Summary
- The `ref` attribute is used to inject non-primitives inside `bean` in spring.
- Difference between Constructor and Setter Injection:

- `Constructor Injection`
  1. Dependencies are `injected` using `constructor` arguments.
  2. `Partial injection` is `not supported`, we `cannot ignore` the property if it is there in `constructor parameter`. All `parameters` of `constructor` must be `injected`.
  3. `Readability` is `poor`, using `name` attribute in `XML` is `optional`.
  4. `Non-parameterized/default` constructor is `not mandatory`.
  5. Does not support `circular dependency`.

- `Setter Injection`
  1. Dependencies are `injected` using `setter` methods.
  2. `Partial injection` is `supported`, we `can ignore` any property for injection.
  3. `Readability` is `better`, using `name` attribute in `XML` is `compulsory`.
  4. `Non-parameterized/default` constructor is `mandatory`.
  5. Supports `circular dependency`.

## Conclusion

### When to use `Constructor Injection`
- They are most `useful` when we need an `object along with all its dependencies`.
- For example â€“ CAR can have various dependencies like engine, gear, steering and other relevant components without which a CAR is Use-Less.
- So, we need all those `components wired together` in the object of a car.

### When to use `Setter Injection`
- They are `preferred` when we have some `optional dependencies` that are `not mandatory` required but can assist in some ways.
- For example, when we `register ourselves` on some `online platform` then we have to provide some `compulsory information` like `name,email,phone number,` but we also have the `freedom` to `set/leave` our `profile picture, personal info` and other information.
- It's completely `optional`.
